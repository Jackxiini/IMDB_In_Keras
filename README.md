# IMDB_In_Keras
The dataset
This lab uses a dataset of 25,000 IMDB reviews. Each review comes with a label. A label of 0 is given to a negative review, and a label of 1 is given to a positive review. The goal of this lab is to create a model that will predict the sentiment of a review, based on the words in the review. You can see more information about this dataset in the Keras website.
